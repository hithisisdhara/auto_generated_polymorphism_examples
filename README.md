# auto_generated_polymorphism_examples
I am teaching a intro java class, and needed something for the student to generate some Java code to practice polymorphism. 
Whave 4-5 classes with some inharitance relationship, and we generate some code to write two methods, where the methods call each other. There is a client code that generates an array of variables of each class type, and you are asked to print all the methods. 
The root class will always have a() and b()
The following clases choose to have a and b both then there won't be a loop of both methods calling each other 

to dO: 
1. fix for more methods 
2. fix the print statement, it should be class method
