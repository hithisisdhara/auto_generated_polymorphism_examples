# auto_generated_polymorphism_examples
I am teaching a intro java class, and needed something for the student to generate some Java code to practice polymorphism. 
Whave 4-5 classes with some inharitance relationship, and we generate some code to write two methods, where the methods call each other. There is a client code that generates an array of variables of each class type, and you are asked to print all the methods. 
I got the basic block for it ready, just need to tweak the root class :)
